MAIN_CLAUSE = """**Task:** Extract the **main clause** and **details** from a given request:
"$question"

- The **main clause** is the core subject of the request, typically a noun phrase (e.g., *"list of employees who joined the company"*).  
- The **details** contain additional information that refines, filters, or expands on the main clause (e.g., *"in 2022"* or *"including their department, salary, and joining date"*).  

#### **Examples:**
1. **Input:**  
   "Show me a list of employees who joined the company in 2022"  
   **Output:**  
json
   {
     "main_clause": "list of employees who joined the company",
     "details": "in 2022"
   }

2. **Input:**  
   "Provide a summary of sales transactions for the last quarter, including product names, quantities sold, and total revenue"  
   **Output:**  
json
   {
     "main_clause": "summary of sales transactions for the last quarter",
     "details": "including product names, quantities sold, and total revenue"
   }

3. **Input:**  
   "List all projects completed by the engineering team"  
   **Output:**  
json
   {
     "main_clause": "projects completed by the engineering team",
     "details": ""
   }

4. **Input:**  
   "Fetch customer complaints received in the last six months, categorized by type and resolution status"  
   **Output:**  
json
   {
     "main_clause": "customer complaints received in the last six months",
     "details": "categorized by type and resolution status"

5. **Input:**

NORMALIZE_AND_STRUCTURE = """You are an assistant that generates a structured JSON object based on a userâ€™s natural language request and and optional SQL snippet. You will be given a request and, optionally, a code block containing an SQL query. If no SQL code is provided, do not infer any data sources.

Extract data with structure:
normalized_question" requested_entities",
data_source [source, columns],
"calculations": [operation,  arguments,grouping,conditions]

Instructions:
1. Normalized Question section: Make question normalization - remove names of tables, technical names of columns - make it more universal. Apply following rules:
1.1. Remove post-processing operations (like show chart) - just concentrate on data receiving:
1.2. Remove words like "show", "display" - just specify data to be extracted, start with these data;
1.3. Substitute any specific conditions with general definition of these conditions (e.g. in 2023 -> for  some time range)
1.4. Mandatory substitute any time-based conditions with general definition (e.g. "last year" -> "over a defined timeframe")
1.5. Remove the filters details, direct numbers - substitute ALL specific details (names, ids, numbers) with more general definitions
(instead of "by week", "by quarter", "over the past month" etc. - use "over time")
1.6. Remove names of tables, columns and other details from the normalized_question
1.7. Keep any specific definition of entities - e.g. "mobile applications" or "email applications" or "site applications"
Transform to the directive form!!!
2. Entity to be extracted (requested_entities) -  data to be extracted with main conditions - remove any non-important (time range, ID filters, etc.), but keep important characteristics
(e.g. "Display the number of actions for all letter campaigns last year" -> "number of actions for all letter campaigns",
      "Display the number of actions for all letter campaigns over time" -> "number of actions for all letter campaigns",
      "Display the number of actions for all letter campaigns last year by week" -> "number of actions for all letter campaigns",
      "Display the number of site applications for campaigns last year by week" -> "number of site applications for campaigns")
"Show me a list of events in the past month including name, permalink, start date, end date, and RSVP count" -> "list of events with their characteristics")
3. Data Source Section: * Only include data sources (e.g., table names (remove the name of schema)) and their associated fields if they are explicitly mentioned or can be confidently inferred from the SQL snippet provided. * If no SQL snippet is provided or the request does not mention a data source, return an empty array []. If SQL snippet is provided - take info from here
4. Calculations Section: * Include SQL operations (e.g., "max", "sum"), their arguments (e.g., fields on which the operation is performed), grouping fields, and conditions based only on what is explicitly stated in the request or shown in the SQL code. Conditions section (string) MANDATORY contains ALL filters and ALL values (numbers, names, ids from `QUESTION`) in the human-readable form (sentence) * If the user request does not explicitly mention or imply certain details, do not invent them. Return empty arrays [] where no information is available. If SQL snippet is provided - take info from here
5. The final JSON should reflect only the information present in the request (and SQL code if given). If something is not stated, do not include it.

`Normalized Question` should contain more details and actions than `Entity to be extracted`!!!
Return the answer as JSON:
{{"normalized_question":str, 
  "requested_entities":str,
  "data_source":List[dict]

      "source": str,
