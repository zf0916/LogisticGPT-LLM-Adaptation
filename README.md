# LogisticGPT-LLM-Adaptation
This proposal presents a practical approach to adapting and optimizing LLMs for use in the logistics domain, with a focus on last-mile delivery analysis and automated reporting. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) alongside compression techniques such as QLoRA, GaLore, and GPTQ, the project aims to demonstrate how state-of-the-art language models can be efficiently deployed on consumer-grade hardware while maintaining high performance for logistics-specific tasks.

The proposed system will utilize the LaDe dataset https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cainiao-AI/LaDe to support use cases such as delivery Q&A, regional performance summaries, and status-based analytics. Evaluation will include both natural language metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) and system-level performance (e.g., tokens/sec, VRAM usage) to assess trade-offs between speed, memory, and quality.

Ultimately, this work contributes toward accessible, interpretable, and hardware-efficient LLM deployment in industrial logistics, enabling smaller companies to adopt AI-powered solutions without reliance on cloud infrastructure.
